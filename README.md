## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Preprocessing
* Handling Missing Values.
* Feature Engineering.
### 2. Clustering
* K-Means Clustering.
* Dimensionality Reduction: PCA .
### 3. Visualization
* Cluster Visualization: PCA is used to plot the customer clusters to observe the separations and overlaps between segments.
* Distributions by Cluster: Boxplots for numerical features and bar charts for categorical features illustrate differences across clusters.
## Key Findings
* Customers are segmented into 4 distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior, satisfaction, and preferences.
* The clusters highlight differences in shopping satisfaction, reviews importance, and areas for improvement, helping to guide personalized strategies.
## Installation
